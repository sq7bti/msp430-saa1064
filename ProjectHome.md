This firmware make it possible to replace hard-to-find SAA1064 to drive 4 digit 7-segment LED displays. It is controlled the very same way as SAA1064 using i2c. Slave address is hardcoded, as well as the scan mode and duty cycle settings, for simplicity sake. SAA drives two pairs of 7-segment digital displays. This one, to save gpios is driving one display with 4 anodes, and 8 cathodes. The polarization can be changed in software, to make it easier adapt to another display. Display can be connected directly to MSP430G2253, or via buffer drives to improve current capabilities.
